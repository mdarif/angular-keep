# About

This is a fork of [Angular RequireJS Seed](https://github.com/tnajdek/angular-requirejs-seed).

* AngularJS 1.2.16
* RequireJS 2.1.9
* Full support for unit and e2e tests
* Support for Karma Test Runner 0.10+ (formerly Testacular)

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-keep repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone angular-keep

Clone the angular-keep repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/mdarif/angular-keep.git
cd angular-keep
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`.

    scripts/            --> handy shell/js/ruby scripts
      e2e-test.sh       --> runs end-to-end tests with Karma (*nix)
      e2e-test.bat      --> runs end-to-end tests with Karma (windows)
      test.bat          --> autotests unit tests with Karma (windows)
      test.sh           --> autotests unit tests with Karma (*nix)
      web-server.js     --> simple development webserver based on node.js

    test/               --> test source files and libraries
      e2e/              -->
        runner.html     --> end-to-end test runner (open in your browser to run)
        scenarios.js    --> end-to-end specs
      lib/
        angular/                --> angular testing libraries
          angular-mocks.js      --> mocks that replace certain angular services in tests
          angular-scenario.js   --> angular's scenario (end-to-end) test runner library

## Testing

    # Run unit tests automatically whenever app changes
    `npm test` or `scripts/test.sh`

    # Run end to end tests (requires web server to be running)
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh`
